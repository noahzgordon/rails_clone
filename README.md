# rails_lite_

A clone of Rails, the popular application development framework.

Much of the work on this project was done with the guidance and assistance
of App Academy's top-notch instructurs. But the following features were built
up from scratch!

##Bonus Features:
+ Consolidation of all "phases" into a single folder
  - The original project proceeded in phases, with a spec to guide each
    phase. I've simplified this down to make it easier to manage.
  - I've also thrown out the specs, which no longer apply.
+ The Flash
  - for quick and easy errors/notices!
  - still need to implement flash.now
+ CSRF protection
  - via an authenticity token stored on the session

###To-Do
+ a routes.rb file which automatically writes routes
+ URL Helpers and URLHelper module
+ link_to and button_to helpers
+ support for rendering partials
+ nested routing
+ integration with ActiveRecord::Lite
  - another project from earlier in the term; there's work to do
    here as well!
